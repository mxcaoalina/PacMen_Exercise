<h2>Introduction</h2>
Pacmen Exercise is a fun and interactive project that simulates the movement of PacMen on the screen. Inspired by the classic PacMan game, this exercise allows you to create multiple PacMen, each with their own unique speed and movement patterns. Watch as these PacMen roam around the screen, bouncing off the walls and changing direction, creating an engaging visual experience.
