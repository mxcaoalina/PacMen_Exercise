Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.

Pacmen Exercise is a fun and interactive project that simulates the movement of PacMen on the screen.

Watch as these PacMen roam around the screen, bouncing off the walls and changing direction, creating an engaging visual experience.
